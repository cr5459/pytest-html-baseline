"""Unified logic tests representing evolution formerly spread across v1/v2/v3.

History (for reference):
 - v1: test_initial_failure failed intentionally; no test_new_failure; no flaky test.
 - v2: test_initial_failure fixed; introduced test_new_failure (regression) and flaky test.
 - v3: flaky stabilized; regression persisted.

We keep the final (v3) state here. Earlier states can be simulated by editing the assertions
or temporarily marking tests xfail.
